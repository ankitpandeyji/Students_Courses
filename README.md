In this dataset, I cleaned the raw data into a structured format.
I used Excel Power Query to clean my raw data and remove duplicates.
Power Query is a Data preprocessor similar to both Power BI and Excel.
First, I upload my Excel data from a server and transform it through Power Query.
Then I cleaned my data and removed all duplicates, lowercase, and Space errors.
